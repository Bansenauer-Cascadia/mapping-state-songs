_**Examples &amp; Descriptions** of some of the people who will use this app._
* **_Curious People_** - With the amount of public marketing planned, there will probably be a number of people that stop by and check it out simply out of curiosity. Most people will probably learn something they did not know before about the US, their home state, or even Washington where they currently reside.
* **_CCC/UW Students_** - There are many students at Cascadia and UWB that may not really know about the types of things the programming and web students are working on, and less aware of what the brand new mobile app class is doing.  This will be a great opportunity to showcase some of the new and exciting things that we are learning to do utilizing new web technologies and highlight what the new mobile apps classes will bring to the table.
* **_International Students_** - This installation would be an excellent opportunity for many international students to learn about the various states in the US.
* **_Faculty_** - The faculty at Cascadia CC and UW Bothell are very interested in what students are learning and how students are applying that knowledge. If they see that the BIT 271 Mobile Apps class has produced an interesting/useful mobile app, they may recommend students to check out the class, or contribute app ideas for future classes.
* **_Staff_** - There are a lot of staff members at Cascadia CC and UWB who will probably walk by the installation area, or check it out while on their break. They might be from different states, and want to check out more info about the state songs. They may also see the app was produced by our class and recommend people they know to check out the BIT classes here.
* **_Grandparents_** 
* **_Parents_**
* **_K-12 Students_** - This project might present a learning opportunity for students in primary and secondary schools, where teachers may choose to take their students here on a field trip. For this audience, we may wish to design a learning pamphlet or acitivty pack to hand out to the students.
