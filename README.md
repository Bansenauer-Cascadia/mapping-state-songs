Most people will probably learn something they did not know before about the US, their home state, or even Washington where they currently reside.
* **_CCC/UW Students_** - There are many students at Cascadia and UWB that may not really know about the types of things the programming and web students are working on, and less aware of what the brand new mobile app class is doing.  This will be a great opportunity to showcase some of the new and exciting things that we are learning to do utilizing new web technologiesthe and highlight what the new mobile apps classes will bring to the table.
